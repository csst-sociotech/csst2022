The sessions will be made up of a combination of four types of events (in addition to social events).

1. Mentoring sessions 
    - Groups of three campers with one mentor.  One hour discussion each day as a group, but focused on one of the campers using the application PDF as basis for discussion

2. Panels
    - 3-5 mentors addressing topics of professional importance, with Q&A from campers.
 
3. Workshops/Master classes
    - Practice focused practical activities lead by mentors. Parallel sessions for 5-10 campers each.

4. Grant proposal workshop sessions
    - Mentors will introduce and give context on solicitations
    - Campers will be organized into groups (random, stratified by career stage) and given a worksheet to assist structuring developing an proposal idea

# Communications

The CSST 2022 Slack is at [https://csst2022.slack.com/](https://csst2022.slack.com/). The workspace will be transferred to the campers as a community space after the end of the institute.

# Mentors

Many thanks to the mentors who have agreed to participate.  We are working on creating mentoring groups of Campers for each mentor (likely 3 campers).

# Travel planning

Flight and ground transportation to/from airports will be reimbursed as described below.

## Flights

Please book and pay for your own flights to Austin airport (AUS), keeping email/PDF receipts for [reimbursement](#reimbursement). We have budgeted to reimburse fights up to $500 per participant, but we understand costs are all over the place, please contact James Howison if your flight costs must exceed $500.

**Arrive** by ~5pm Monday June 6 (giving enough time to check in and attend 6pm reception event). Accomodation checkin is ~2pm.

**Depart** either Thursday June 9 or Friday June 10. If Thursday (and missing optional social event) earliest flight at 6pm Thursday, please.
A survey will be sent via email to ask if accomodation is required for the Thursday night (i.e., if you are departing on Thursday evening or Friday).

## Airport transfers

We will reimburse airport transfers (to/from departure airport, to/from Austin airport). Austin airport has signage for their ride-sharing/taxi pickup (recommend requesting a ride while in the terminal). Please organize yourselves, pay, and keep receipts for [reimbursement](#reimbursement). We anticipate ground transportation up to $100 per participant (and encourage shared rides where possible).

# Accomodation

Accomodation for both campers and mentors will be booked and paid directly, no reimbursement required.

Accomodation for campers will be on campus at UT Austin. Considering COVID this year all campers will have single rooms. To make that work in the budget you will need to bring your own towel.  So, uh, make like Douglas Adams said :)  Breakfast for campers is available either in on campus dining or in restaurants nearby (reimbursed via per diem).  My personal favorite, en route from campus to the iSchool, is [Arturo's Underground Cafe](https://goo.gl/maps/Zs65oJPuFe2AeSx59).

Accomodation for mentors is at the [Hilton Garden Inn Austin University Capitol District](https://goo.gl/maps/m6QusE9WzbvwYnMZA). Breakfast is included.

# Meals

For breakfast, see [Accommodation](#accomodation).

Other meals will be either provided by the event or self-paid and reimbursed (please keep receipts).  Meals will include small group reservations at restaurants around town, with sign up sheets during the event.

# Reimbursement

Thanks to support from the NSF, the Sloan Foundation, and the Texas iSchool, we are able to provide travel, meals, and accomodation, as discussed above. Details for filing reimbursements will be provided before the event. Please keep all receipts for reimbursement.

# Packing List

Everyone:

- hot weather clothes (temps could hit 100Â° in the afternoons)
- hat
- sunscreen
- refillable water bottle
- swimming clothes/towel (for optional Thursday afternoon trip to Barton Springs)
- lightweight sweater (air conditioning can sometimes go awry)

Additionally required for Campers:

- towel
- soap

# Covid policies

Masks will be optional and we will have masks available on site.

We are asking everyone to take a rapid test prior to departing for travel, and not to attend if positive, or if a member of your household is testing positive.  Additional rapid tests will be available at the Monday evening welcome session (and each day).
