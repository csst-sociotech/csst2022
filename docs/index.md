# Communications

The CSST 2022 Slack is at [https://csst2022.slack.com/](https://csst2022.slack.com/). The workspace will be transferred to the campers as a community space after the end of the institute.

# Travel planning

Flight and ground transportation to/from airports will be reimbursed. 

## Flights

Please book and pay for your own flights to Austin airport (AUS), keeping email/PDF receipts for [reimbursement](#reimbursement).

**Arrive** by ~5pm Monday June 6 (giving enough time to check in and attend 6pm reception event). Accomodation checkin is ~2pm.

**Depart** either after 5pm Thursday June 9 or anytime Friday June 10.

A survey will be sent via email to ask if accomodation is required for the Thursday night (i.e., if you are departing on Thursday evening or Friday).

## Airport transfers

We will reimburse airport transfers (to/from departure airport, to/from Austin airport). Austin airport has signage for their ride-sharing/taxi pickup (recommend requesting a ride while in the terminal). Please organize yourselves, pay, and keep receipts for [reimbursement](#reimbursement).

# Accomodation

Accomodation for both campers and mentors will be paid directly, no reimbursement required.

Accomodation for campers will be on campus at UT Austin. Considering COVID this year all campers will have single rooms. To make that work in the budget you will need to bring your own towel.  So, uh, make like Douglas Adams said :)  Breakfast for campers is available either in on campus dining or in restaurants nearby (reimbursed via per diem).  My personal favorite, en route from campus to the iSchool, is [Arturo's Underground Cafe](https://goo.gl/maps/Zs65oJPuFe2AeSx59).

Accomodation for mentors is at the [Hilton Garden Inn Austin University Capitol District](https://goo.gl/maps/m6QusE9WzbvwYnMZA). Breakfast is included.

# Meals

For breakfast, see [Accommodation](#accomodation).

Other meals will be either provided by the event or self-paid and reimbursed via per diem (no receipts required). See [Federal Meals & Incidental Expenses breakdown for Austin TX](https://www.gsa.gov/travel/plan-book/per-diem-rates/per-diem-rates-results/?action=perdiems_report&state=TX&fiscal_year=2022&zip=78701&city=). That amount is reduced by the per diem breakdown for meals provided by the conference or hotel. So, for example, if a dinner is provided then the per diem rate for that day is reduced by the amount shown for dinner.

# Reimbursement

Thanks to support from the NSF, the Sloan Foundation, and the Texas iSchool, we are able to provide travel, meals, and accomodation.

## Reimbursement for Mentors

Mentors will file through UT Austin. Forms and instructions to come.

## Reimbursement for Campers

Campers will file through Drexel. Forms and instructions to come.
