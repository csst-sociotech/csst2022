1. Mentoring sessions 
    - Groups of three campers with one mentor.  One hour discussion each day as a group, but focused on one of the campers using the application PDF as basis for discussion

2. Panels
    - 3-5 mentors addressing topics of professional importance, with Q&A from campers.
 
3. Workshops/Master classes
    - Practice focused practical activities lead by mentors. Parallel sessions for 5-10 campers each.

4. Grant proposal workshop sessions
    - Mentors will introduce and give context on solicitations
    - Campers will be organized into groups (random, stratified by career stage) and given a worksheet to assist structuring developing an proposal idea

# Communications

The CSST 2022 Slack is at [https://csst2022.slack.com/](https://csst2022.slack.com/). The workspace will be transferred to the campers as a community space after the end of the institute.

# Mentors

Many thanks to the mentors who have agreed to participate.  We are working on creating mentoring groups of Campers for each mentor (likely 3 campers).

# Travel planning

Flight and ground transportation to/from airports will be reimbursed as described below.

## Flights

Please book and pay for your own flights to Austin airport (AUS), keeping email/PDF receipts for [reimbursement](#reimbursement). We have budgeted to reimburse fights up to $500 per participant, but we understand costs are all over the place, please contact James Howison if your flight costs must exceed $500.

**Arrive** by ~5pm Monday June 6 (giving enough time to check in and attend 6pm reception event). Accomodation checkin is ~2pm.

**Depart** either Thursday June 9 or Friday June 10. If Thursday (and missing optional social event) earliest flight at 6pm Thursday, please.
A survey will be sent via email to ask if accomodation is required for the Thursday night (i.e., if you are departing on Thursday evening or Friday).

## Airport transfers

We will reimburse airport transfers (to/from departure airport, to/from Austin airport). Austin airport has signage for their ride-sharing/taxi pickup (recommend requesting a ride while in the terminal). Please organize yourselves, pay, and keep receipts for [reimbursement](#reimbursement). We anticipate ground transportation up to $100 per participant (and encourage shared rides where possible).

# Accomodation

Accomodation for both campers and mentors will be booked and paid directly, no reimbursement required.

Accomodation for campers will be on campus at UT Austin at the [Blanton Residence Hall](https://goo.gl/maps/emRBwruVvDfmg9Kg6); contact details foer it are on the [university page for Blanton Hall](https://housing.utexas.edu/housing/residence-halls/residence-hall-locations/blanton-hall) Campers can check in on Sunday or Monday and check out on Thursday or Friday.  Check-in is available 24 hours, but might be a little slow after hours. University Housing provided this info on check-in:

> Check-In: Check-in is easy and a three-step process. 1. Go to front desk of the dorm and state that you are with a conference group and state the name of the conference. 2. If 17 years of age and up we will ask for some form of ID to verify the name  of the summer conference registration. 3. Once confirmed, we will then issue you a summer conference card (white card) and room key (Dobie has a fob)

> Conference White Card vs UT ID: You will be issued a summer conference card at check-in. This summer card is not an official UT ID card and will only work for UHD meal plans and door swipe access to enter the wing or sections of the dorm. Your group may require you to get an official UT ID card. If you get a UT Card you will still need to use both cards for they do not merge access to one. Lost cards are $10 each.

> Key: A key or fob will be given at check-in with the summer conference card. if they key is lost the student or group will be charged $75 per key.

> Parking: If you have questions about parking. Please contact parking at parking@austin.utexas.edu.
> Check out. 1. Go to front desk of the dorm and state that you are with a conference group and state the name of the conference 2. We will pull up your information and ask for your key (fob) and card back.
> Wifi: Use "utguest" network which does not require a password.

Considering COVID this year all campers will have single rooms. To make that work in the budget you will need to bring your own towel.  So, uh, make like Douglas Adams said :)  Breakfast for campers is available either in on campus dining or in restaurants nearby (reimbursed via per diem).  My personal favorite, en route from campus to the iSchool, is [Arturo's Underground Cafe](https://goo.gl/maps/Zs65oJPuFe2AeSx59).

Accomodation for mentors is at the [Hilton Garden Inn Austin University Capitol District](https://goo.gl/maps/m6QusE9WzbvwYnMZA). Breakfast is included.

# Meals

For breakfast, see [Accommodation](#accomodation).

Other meals will be either provided by the event or self-paid and reimbursed (please keep receipts).  Meals will include small group reservations at restaurants around town, with sign up sheets during the event.

# Reimbursement

Thanks to support from the NSF, the Sloan Foundation, and the Texas iSchool, we are able to provide travel, meals, and accomodation, as discussed above. Details for filing reimbursements will be provided before the event. Please keep all receipts for reimbursement.

# Packing List

Everyone:

- hot weather clothes (temps could hit 100Â° in the afternoons)
- hat
- sunscreen
- refillable water bottle
- swimming clothes/towel (for optional Thursday afternoon trip to Barton Springs)
- lightweight sweater (air conditioning can sometimes go awry)
- umbrella or lightweight raincoat (walking for lunch, to and from accomodation)

Additionally required for Campers:

- towel
- soap

# Covid policies

Masks will be optional and we will have masks available on site.

We are asking everyone to take a rapid test prior to departing for travel, and not to travel if positive, or if a member of your household is testing positive.  Additional rapid tests will be available at the Monday evening welcome session (and each day), please test if you display symptoms and do not attend any events if you test positive.  Contact the organizers and we will help.

# Code of conduct

The code of conduct below is based on the [ACM CSCW 2020 code of conduct](https://cscw.acm.org/2020/code-of-conduct/). 

Welcome to CSST 2022. We believe in respect, compassion, understanding, and inclusion. We expect all community members to act in accordance with these values to create spaces where everyone can participate fully without fear of judgment or harassment.

We expect participants to adhere to expected professional behavior of conference participants, including:

- Treating everyone with respect and consideration; under the umbrella of respect, we expect all participants to be mindful of their speech and behaviors.
- Communicating openly and thoughtfully with others and being considerate of the multitude of views and opinions that may be different than your own.
- Being respectful and mindful in your critique of ideas.
- Respecting othersâ identities in full, e.g., using their specified pronouns.
- Respecting othersâ right to engage or disengage in conversation.
- Accepting responsibility to take action, as bystanders and advocates, to call out and report misbehavior and to hold each other accountable to the Code.

We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Participants violating these rules may be removed from the institute at the discretion of the organizers.

Harassment includes, but is not limited to, these behaviors:

- Comments that target other participants based on characteristics such as gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, age, ability, status, physical appearance, body size, or religion.
- Unwelcome personal attention, particularly when one individual has authority over the other.
- Persistent, unwanted attempts to contact another group member, particularly when one individual has authority over the other.
- Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or threats of violence.
- Sustained disruption of presentations, events, or online discussion.
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.

These principles apply in person; on the event Slack; and communications between participants through other forms of contact. Be mindful that having shared, for example, a phone number for coordination during an event, does not neccessarily indicate an invitation for ongoing communication.

We expect everyone to participate in enforcing these policies. Any community member can report violations of the CSST Code of Conduct. Reports can be named or anonymous. We encourage peers and especially senior community members to make reports on behalf of colleagues who are not in a position to do so themselves, preferably with their consent. Options for reporting include:

On site contacts:
- James Howison, CSST Organizer. Email: jhowison@ischool.utexas.edu (or DM on CSST 2022 Slack)
- Melissa Mazmanian, CSST Mentor. Email: mmazmani@uci.edu (or DM on CSST 2022 Slack)

If the issue would best be handled outside of mentors on site for the event contact:
- Jamie Snyder, CSST Steering committee member, Email: jas1208@uw.edu
- Katie Shilton CSST Steering committee member, Email: kshilton@umd.edu

Once we have received notification of a complaint, we will follow up and determine appropriate action.
