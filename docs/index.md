# Mentors

Many thanks to the mentors who have agreed to participate.  We are working on creating mentoring groups of Campers for each mentor (likely 3 campers).

# Campers

Announcement coming very soon.

# Travel planning

Flight and ground transportation to/from airports will be reimbursed. 

## Flights

Please book and pay for your own flights to Austin airport (AUS), keeping email/PDF receipts for [reimbursement](#reimbursement). We have budgeted to reimburse fights up to $500 per participant, but we understand costs are all over the place, please contact James Howison if your flight costs must exceed $500.

**Arrive** by ~5pm Monday June 6 (giving enough time to check in and attend 6pm reception event). Accomodation checkin is ~2pm.

**Depart** either Thursday June 9 or Friday June 10. If Thursday (and missing optional social event) earliest flight at 6pm Thursday, please.
A survey will be sent via email to ask if accomodation is required for the Thursday night (i.e., if you are departing on Thursday evening or Friday).

## Airport transfers

We will reimburse airport transfers (to/from departure airport, to/from Austin airport). Austin airport has signage for their ride-sharing/taxi pickup (recommend requesting a ride while in the terminal). Please organize yourselves, pay, and keep receipts for [reimbursement](#reimbursement). We anticipate ground transportation at around $100 per participant (and encourage shared rides where possible).

# Accomodation

Accomodation for both campers and mentors will be booked and paid directly, no reimbursement required.

Accomodation for campers will be on campus at UT Austin. Considering COVID this year all campers will have single rooms. To make that work in the budget you will need to bring your own towel.  So, uh, make like Douglas Adams said :)  Breakfast for campers is available either in on campus dining or in restaurants nearby (reimbursed via per diem).  My personal favorite, en route from campus to the iSchool, is [Arturo's Underground Cafe](https://goo.gl/maps/Zs65oJPuFe2AeSx59).

Accomodation for mentors is at the [Hilton Garden Inn Austin University Capitol District](https://goo.gl/maps/m6QusE9WzbvwYnMZA). Breakfast is included.

# Meals

For breakfast, see [Accommodation](#accomodation).

Other meals will be either provided by the event or self-paid and reimbursed.

# Reimbursement

Thanks to support from the NSF, the Sloan Foundation, and the Texas iSchool, we are able to provide travel, meals, and accomodation. Details for filing reimbursements will be provided before the event. Please keep all receipts for reimbursement.
